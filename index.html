        <p>What is Google Fibre and why is it worth knowing about? It’s the latest technology in internet and television service providers and allows for upload and download speeds of over 1 gigabit per second! Imagine that you need a movie for movie night with some friends. That’s not a problem with gigabit download speeds! You can download an entire digital move (14 GB!) in just under 2 minutes. </p>
        <p>If that isn’t enough to leave your mouth drooling in awe, optic fiber cables are made of high quality glass to transmit signals. That means you can transfer and download data over the internet about as fast your computer writes data to its own hard drive. That’s right, now the entire World Wide Web is your oyster, and it’s a big oyster indeed. </p>
