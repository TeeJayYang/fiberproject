        <h2>Google Moves to Expand Fiber, Its Fast Internet</h2>
        <p>Google is expanding its ultrahigh-speed internet service, google fiber into over 30 cities across the United States in order to help push the standard of internet speeds higher.
          <br><br>
          With Fiber running 100 times faster than current broadband copper cable connections, only 7.7 percent of Americans have Fiber compared to the 67% in some parts of Asia.
          <br><br>
          Many other internet service providers are forced to offer better services at a lower cost in light of potential Google Fiber competition but the Google rates in Kansas, where the Fiber service was already deployed, are still quite less expensive than other ISPs in the area.
          <br><br>
          Instead of coming to cities to ask to install the infrastructure, Google invites cities to send in the preparation and building maps. This ensures that Google can put up its Fiber on existing poles and allows for a smoother operation for permit requests. 
          <br><br>
          Having shown themselves as a potential competitor for the Comcast and Time Warner Cable Merger, Google hopes to expand to 34 cities across the country by the start of next year.
