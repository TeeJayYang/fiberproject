        <h2>Why Is Optic Fiber Faster?</h2>
        <p>What is this fiber optics magic that allows me to send 1s and 0s over the internet so quickly? While a copper cable transmits signals through electric pulses at very high voltages, fiber uses light. With different glass layers outlining a single thread of optic fiber, light is able to reflect on the inside of the cable to ensure that there is no signal loss along the way from the servers to your home.
            <br><br>While a copper wire can only send one electric pulse at a time along a strand of copper, a single strand of optic fiber no thicker than a piece of human hair can transmit hundreds of beams of light across the light spectrum. All this information travelling at the speed of light (300 000 km/h!) is now going through a wire that is HUNDREDS OF TIMES more efficient!<br><br>Want to find the disk of that movie that you want to watch? Itâ€™s probably faster to download it from the web than putting the disk into your computer. </p>
